## What is Docker? 

Docker is a tool which helps:

Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings
